Scientists have made a startling discovery on Mars: puppies!

The discovery was made by the Curiosity rover, which was exploring the Red Planet when it came across a group of small, furry creatures playing in a field. The rover was able to get close enough to get clear images of the puppies, which appear to be about the size of small dogs.

The discovery has sent shockwaves through the scientific community, as it provides the first concrete evidence of life on Mars. Scientists are still trying to determine how the puppies came to be on Mars, but they believe that they may have arrived on a meteor or comet.

The discovery of the puppies is a major breakthrough in the search for life beyond Earth, and it has raised the possibility that there may be other intelligent life forms in the universe. Scientists are eager to learn more about the puppies, and they hope to be able to make contact with them soon.

They appear to be about the size of small dogs.
