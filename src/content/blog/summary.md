# The Summary of Our Assignment & Articles

The articles, which we have written, are about the following topics:

- Cancer Cure is Found
- Dogs on Mars
- Eating Chocolate Can Reduce Your Weight
- World War III Breaks Out
- Find Your Future
- Golden State Warriors won NBA 2022 Championship
- KFC Brings New Nuggets
- Snoop dogg is getting divorced
- Your next steak could be 3D printed
- Michael Meechin is the principal of NeoCity Academy

its categories are:

- True

- False

and the articles that are true are:

- Find Your Future
- Golden State Warriors won NBA 2022 Championship
- KFC Brings New Nuggets
- Your next steak could be 3D printed
- Michael Meechin is the principal of NeoCity Academy

and the articles that are false are:

- Cancer Cure is Found
- Dogs on Mars
- Eating Chocolate Can Reduce Your Weight
- World War III Breaks Out
- Snoop dogg is getting divorced

so, I have written 10 articles and 5 of them are true and 5 of them are false. 

The way that I wrote my stories, is using current day events that are either political, for fun such as music, etc. I also used some of my own ideas that I thought would be interesting to write about. I also used some of the ideas that were given to us in class. I think that the most important things here are the way that I wrote the articles using the different ways to distinguish if an article is true by using the following things to identify if an article is true or false:

- The title
- The date
- The author
- The tags
- The image
- The snippet
- The content

And all of this led to me being able to try and trick but yet make it credible that it is either true or false.
